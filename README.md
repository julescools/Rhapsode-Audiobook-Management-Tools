# 🎙️ Rhapsode Audiobook File Manager (Designed for use with Audiobookshelf service)

> *An audiobook toolbox launcher.*
>
> A **rhapsode** was the ancient Greek performer who recited Homer and Virgil from memory — the Homeric equivalent of an audiobook narrator. Rhapsode-the-launcher recites on your behalf, dispatching a collection of audiobook-management scripts against the directory of your choice.

## ✨ What it does

A single-file Python launcher that puts a friendly menu in front of a dozen standalone audiobook-management scripts. Designed for people who maintain their own library (Audiobookshelf, Plex, a shelf of ripped CDs) and find themselves doing the same handful of cleanup tasks over and over.

- 🔪 **Split & extract** — slice long audio files into equal chunks, extract segments by time, split m4b files by chapter
- 🧵 **Join** — merge Libation-style chapter files (and cover art) into a single audiobook
- 📂 **Organize** — flatten multi-disc folder structures into clean flat libraries
- ✏️ **Rename** — add prefixes, strip junk, collapse Part/Chapter/Subchapter numbering
- 🧹 **Metadata & repair** — clear ID3 tags, re-encode corrupt MP3s
- 📚 **Library management** — full scanner/fixer for an Audiobookshelf root

Every tool is standalone and can be run directly. Rhapsode just provides a menu.

## 📋 Requirements

### 🟥 Required

| | Requirement | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| 🐍 | **Python 3.8 or later** | Launcher + every `.py` tool |
| 🎬 | **ffmpeg + ffprobe** on your PATH | Any tool that touches audio |

### 🟦 Optional Python packages

Only needed for the specific tools that use them:

| Package | Install | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `mutagen` | `pip install mutagen` | `clear_mp3_metadata.py`, `audiobook_manager.py` |
| `rapidfuzz` | `pip install rapidfuzz` | `audiobook_manager.py` |
| `rich` | `pip install rich` | `audiobook_manager.py` |

> 💡 **You don't actually have to pre-install these.** `audiobook_manager.py` auto-prompts to install its own dependencies on first run.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Python

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| 🪟 Windows | [python.org installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (check **Add to PATH**) or `winget install Python.Python.3` |
| 🍎 macOS | `brew install python` |
| 🐧 Linux | `sudo apt install python3` (or your distro's equivalent) |

Verify:
```bash
python --version
```

### 2️⃣ ffmpeg

The engine behind almost every audio operation. You need both `ffmpeg` **and** `ffprobe` on your PATH.

```bash
# 🪟 Windows
winget install ffmpeg

# 🍎 macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# 🐧 Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# 🐧 Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

Verify:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

### 3️⃣ Python packages (one-shot, optional)

```bash
pip install mutagen rapidfuzz rich
```

Or use:
```bash
python -m pip install mutagen rapidfuzz rich
```

### 4️⃣ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julescools/rhapsode.git
cd rhapsode
```

### 5️⃣ Run

```bash
python rhapsode.py
```

🎉 Done.

🔍 Rhapsode discovers tools by **exact filename**. If you rename a file in `Tools/`, update the matching `filename=` entry in the `CATEGORIES` list near the top of `rhapsode.py`.

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick start

```bash
cd "/path/to/my/audiobook"
python /path/to/rhapsode/rhapsode.py
```

By default, the **target directory** (where the tools operate) is your current working directory — usually the book you're working on. Change it at any time with `d`.

### Menu controls

| Key | Action |
|:---:|---|
| `1` – `N` | ▶️ Run a tool |
| `d` | 📂 Change target directory |
| `i` | ℹ️ Show details about a tool |
| `s` | 📋 Status — list all tools, flag any missing files |
| `q` | 🚪 Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | ⏹ Interrupt a running tool and return to the menu |

## 🧰 The toolbox

### 📚 Library
- **Audiobook Library Manager** — full scanner/fixer for an Audiobookshelf root. Scan cache, corrupt-file detection, batch renames, fuzzy-match cleanup. This is the big one.

### 🔪 Split & Extract
- **Slice or extract segment** — split one file into equal chunks, extract a segment by start/end time, or split by chapter markers. Uses `-c copy` → no re-encoding, no quality loss.
- **Extract m4b chapters (parallel)** — for each `.m4b` in the target dir, extract every chapter into its own file, multi-threaded with live progress.

### 🧵 Join
- **Join Libation m4b parts + cover** — merge all `.m4b` files in a directory into one audiobook, preserving chapter markers and embedding `cover.jpg`.
- **Combine audio files (batch, Windows)** — ffmpeg concat example in a `.bat`. ⚠️ Currently hardcoded to one specific trilogy — edit before use.

### 📂 Organize
- **Flatten multi-disc audiobook folders** — take `Disc 1 / Disc 2 / CD3 / …` subfolders and collapse them into a single flat directory with renumbered tracks. Includes interactive disc-order review before anything is renamed.
- **Flatten multi-disc video folders** — same logic, for video.

### ✏️ Rename
- **PretextEdit** — add a prefix to every file in the target directory, or across multiple selected subdirectories. Live preview of the first N renames before committing.
- **Part/Chapter/Subchapter → sequential** — collapse nested numbering like `Title 01 - 02 - 03.mp3` into flat `Title - 001.mp3`. (Originally written for *Lolita*; edit the regex for other titles.)
- **Strip text before first space** (Windows) — removes everything up to the first space from every filename. Useful for stripping indexing junk.

### 🧹 Metadata & Repair
- **Clear all MP3 metadata** — strips every ID3 tag from every `.mp3` in the target dir.
- **Repair MP3 (re-encode)** — re-encodes every `.mp3` through ffmpeg to fix header/frame corruption. Keeps `.backup` files alongside.

## 🧠 How dispatch works (briefly)

Most tools use `Path.cwd()` to find their working directory, so Rhapsode just runs them as subprocesses with `cwd=target_dir`.

A few tools (`PretextEdit`, `clear_mp3_metadata`, `join_libation`, `video` flattener) resolve their working dir via `__file__` — for those, Rhapsode briefly copies the script into the target directory as `_rhapsode_<name>`, runs it, and deletes the copy when it finishes.

🔒 **No tool in `Tools/` is ever modified.** The launcher is a dispatcher, not a rewrite. Each script can still be run standalone by `cd`-ing into a directory and invoking it directly.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>❌ "ffmpeg not found"</b></summary>

ffmpeg or ffprobe isn't on your PATH. Install it (see above) and then **close and reopen your terminal**. On Windows, occasionally you need to log out and back in.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>❓ A tool shows up as (missing) in the status list</b></summary>

The filename in `Tools/` doesn't exactly match the `filename=` entry in `CATEGORIES` in `rhapsode.py`. Filenames are case-sensitive on macOS and Linux.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ "A previous temp copy already exists"</b></summary>

Rhapsode didn't clean up its temp copy from a previous crashed run. Look for `_rhapsode_*` in your target directory and delete it manually, then retry.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💥 UnicodeEncodeError on Windows with non-ASCII filenames</b></summary>

Your console code page isn't UTF-8. The launcher reconfigures stdout/stderr automatically on modern Python, but if you hit this, run:
```powershell
chcp 65001
```
before launching.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 A tool needs a pip package I don't have</b></summary>

```bash
pip install mutagen rapidfuzz rich
```
That's the full list across every tool in the toolbox.
</details>

## 📝 Design notes

- 🪶 **No tool is modified.** Rhapsode is a dispatcher. Every script in `Tools/` can still be run standalone.
- 🎚️ **`-c copy` everywhere possible.** The extract/split/join tools avoid re-encoding by default — you keep your source bitrate, tags, and cover art.
- 🔤 **Windows console safety.** Stdout/stderr get reconfigured to UTF-8 on Windows to avoid the encoding crashes that show up with some Unicode filenames.
- 🧩 **Adding your own tool.** Drop a script into `Tools/`, then add a `Tool(...)` entry to the right category in `CATEGORIES` at the top of `rhapsode.py`. Set `needs_copy=True` if your script uses `__file__` to resolve its working directory.
